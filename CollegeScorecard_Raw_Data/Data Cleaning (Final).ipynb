The reason for this is because there's a lot of data that is missing or not reported when down on that stratified level, and because reducing the ambitious scope of the original project proposal makes cleaning and analyzing the data much easier. We'll also be removing cohort counts, which are the sample sizes of the cohorts used to calculate the student-related variables in the dataset, since those aren't relevant to our analysis.\n",

However, since we don't care about sub-demographic data, we'll remove columns where net price is broken down by income level.

    "#### Filling in null values for completion rate\n",
    "We begin by looking at the cases where `compl_rate_4yr_150nt` is either null or 0. We could fill in the null values using a summary statistic such as the mean, but there's a similar variable called `t_iv.completed_by.6yrs` that's calculated for all Title IV students at the institution. One caveat is that the cohort in the former is the 2008-2009 first-year enrollment cohort, while the cohort in the latter is the 2010-2011 first-year enrollment cohort. Still, a two-year difference isn't massive enough to be an issue for our purposes. Using the `.info()` method on specific slices of the DataFrame, we can determine whether replacing null and 0 values with corresponding Title IV variables would decrease the percentage of missing/invalid values to below 1%.

As with before, there are two variables (one general and one for Title IV students) related to student retention over a similar time period: `retention_rate.four_year.full_time` and `t_iv.still_enrolled_by.2yrs`. The former is for the 2013-2014 enrollment cohort, while the latter is for the 2012-2013 enrollment cohort. Still, we will assume that the actual retention rate doesn't change dramatically between one year and the next. Although the number of 0 values is below 1%, it doesn't make sense for any collge to have no students returning the next year, so we need to clean those cases as well. Again, we use the `.info()` method to determine whether filling in null and 0 values with corresponding Title IV values would make this column complete enough."
